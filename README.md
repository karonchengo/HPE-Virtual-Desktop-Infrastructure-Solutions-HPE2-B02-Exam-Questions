<h1>HPE Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Solutions</h1>

<p>This exam tests the candidate&#39;s ability to display competency with multiple VDI technologies and VDI deployment models. The candidate will also be tested on their understanding of automation, management, and orchestration tools relevant to VDI to optimize resiliency, availability, performance, deployment, and manageability. This exam is targeted to solution architects who have experience gathering and evaluating customers&rsquo; stated requirements to architect and design a solution that delivers the desired user experience for desktop applications which may span different VDI technologies depending on the workloads. Candidates typically define business needs, propose, and may deploy, the solution.</p>
